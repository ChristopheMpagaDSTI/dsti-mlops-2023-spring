Introduction to Git

## Objectives

This workshop can be done **in groups of 2-3 people**.

1. Create a repository and clone it on your computer
2. Create a branch and navigate between branches
3. Modify a file in the repository and push the modifications
4. Manage conflicts

## Before starting

1. Create a GitHub account: https://github.com/
2. Install an IDE or text editor (ex: https://code.visualstudio.com/ or https://atom.io/)
3. Install Git:

  - Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/
  - Linux: https://git-scm.com/download/linux
  - macOS: https://git-scm.com/download/mac

  You can now open Terminal (on Linux or macOS) or Git Bash (on Windows).

  You can find a detailed list of the different Git CLI commands:

## 1. Create a repository and clone it on your computer

**A single member** of the group creates a repository:

1. Log in to [Github.com](https://github.com/)
2. Navigate to the **"Your repositories"** page
3. Click on **"New"**
  - Choose a name
  - Chose the **"Public"** option
  - Check the box **"Add a README file"**
  - Check the box **"Add .gitignore"** with the **"Node"** template
4. Navigate to the created repository, then to the **Settings â†’ Manage Access** page
5. Click on **"Invite a collaborator"** and add the other members of your group
6. **All group members** clone the repository. You now have a copy of the local repository
7. **A single member** of the group creates the `develop` branch. He also creates **"README.md"** file if it doesn't exist. Otherwise, just modify the content. Push the changes to the remote repository. 
8. **The other members** of the group synchronize their local repos with the remote repo (= get the changes from the remote repo).

## 2. Manage conflicts

A conflict occurs when a part of a file has been modified on 2 branches which must be merged (**merge**). We will create a conflict to see how to resolve it.

Both **2 members** of the group create a branch from `develop` and modify the same part (same lines) of the **README.md** file:

1. Create a branch `dev-firstname` from the `develop` branch
2. Edit the **README.md** file
3. Commit changes
4. Push your changes

Alternately, each member merges the new branches into `develop` (on GitHub):

5. Open the pull request
6. Read the information that GitHub gives you about the branch comparison
7. Merge the first `dev-firstname` branch into the `develop` branch
8. Repeat the same steps for the second `dev-firstname`
9. **The 2nd member** of the group will encounter a conflict:
  - Open the IDE as suggested by GitHub
  - The conflict materializes as follows:
  
  ![Merge conflict](image/merge.jpg)

  - To resolve the conflict, keep either the `HEAD` part or the `dev-firstname` part and delete the other lines (including the `====` and `>>>>` lines)
  - Once the lines are deleted you can commit the merge:

1. Learn [the difference between merge and rebase](https://dzone.com/articles/merging-vs-rebasing)
2. Learn [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) - a specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages.
3. Learn **squashing** commits (reference [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git))
4. Add multiple remotes (reference [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes))

6. Rebasing (reference [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing))
